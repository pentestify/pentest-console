NAME
    Parse::Nessus::XML - Interface to Nessus XML result files

SYNOPSIS
      use Parse::Nessus::XML
      my $scan = Parse::Nessus::XML->new( $filename );
      my @results = $scan->results;

      my $plugin  = $scan->plugin(10964); # Parse::Nessus::XML::Plugin object
      my $name    = $plugin->name;

DESCRIPTION
    Provides an interface to the Nessus XML report file. This is primarily
    for my own use, so if it's missing stuff that you think should be in
    here, send me a patch.

    Please note that this API is just a suggestion, and is subject to change
    in the first few releases. Because of how deeply nested the data
    structure is, there's no particularly nice API to the whole thing - at
    least that I can think of. See the example script in the example/
    subdirectory to see how I use this in real life.

  new
      my $scan = Parse::Nessus::XML->new( $filename );

    Given the path to a file, returns a Parse::Nessus::XML object.

  results
        my $results = $scan->results; # listref
        my @results = $scan->results; # list

  plugin
    Returns a plugin object, given the ID. Then you can call for attributes
    off of that object.

      my $plugin = $scan->plugin(10964);
      $name = $plugin->name;
      $risk = $plugin->risk;

  package Parse::Nessus::XML::Plugin
    Supplementary package which facilitates figuring out what's in a
    particular plugin. Also allows location of a plugin by ID number, which
    speeds things up.

  Parse::Nessus::XML::Plugin->new
      my $plugin = Parse::Nessus::XML::Plugin->new( $scan, ID => 10964 );
      my $risk = $plugin->risk;

    Available attributes are: id, name, version, family, cve_id, bugtraq_id,
    category, risk, summary, copyright
